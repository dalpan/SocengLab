    {
        term: "Reciprocity",
        category: "Psychology",
        definition: "The human tendency to feel obliged to return a favor. Attackers exploit this by offering something 'free' (help, a file, a compliment) to create a debt.",
        example: "An attacker helps you solve a minor IT issue unprompted, then asks for your password to 'verify the fix'.",
        defense: "Recognize that the initial favor was likely a lure. Accept the help if genuine, but reject the obligation."
    },
    {
        term: "Scarcity",
        category: "Psychology",
        definition: "People value what is rare or dwindling. Attackers create artificial time pressure or limited availability to bypass critical thinking.",
        example: "\"Your account will be deleted in 24 hours\" or \"Only 2 spots left for the bonus claim.\"",
        defense: "Pause. Whenever you feel urgency, take a breath. Verify the claim through an official channel."
    },
    {
        term: "Authority",
        category: "Psychology",
        definition: "We are conditioned to obey authority figures. Attackers impersonate CEOs, Police, or IT Administrators to demand compliance.",
        example: "A deepfake voice call from the CEO demanding an immediate wire transfer.",
        defense: "Verify identity. Call the person back on a known internal number. Authority figures will respect security verification."
    },
    {
        term: "Consistency (Commitment)",
        category: "Psychology",
        definition: "Once we make a choice or take a stand, we encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment.",
        example: "Attacker asks for a small request first (answer a survey), then a larger one (download a file).",
        defense: "Recognize the 'Foot-in-the-Door' technique. It is okay to change your mind if the request escalates."
    },
    {
        term: "Liking",
        category: "Psychology",
        definition: "We prefer to say yes to people we like. Attackers use charm, similarity, and compliments to build rapport.",
        example: "An attacker researches your hobbies (e.g., golf) and strikes up a conversation about it before asking for sensitive data.",
        defense: "Separate the requester from the request. Like the person, but verify the policy."
    },
    {
        term: "Social Proof",
        category: "Psychology",
        definition: "We view a behavior as more correct in a given situation to the degree that we see others performing it.",
        example: "\"70% of your colleagues have already updated their password here.\"",
        defense: "Don't just follow the herd. Security is an individual responsibility."

        example: "Posing as a fellow employee who forgot their badge.",
        defense: "Verify, Verify, Verify. Don't rely on the story provided by the requester."
    },
    {
        term: "Phishing",
        category: "Attack Vector",
        definition: "Sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source, usually through email.",
        example: "An email looking like Microsoft 365 asking you to login again.",
        defense: "Check sender address, hover over links, and never enter credentials from an email link."
    },
    {
        term: "Spear Phishing",
        category: "Attack Vector",
        definition: "Targeted phishing where the attacker researches the victim to make the message highly personalized and convincing.",
        example: "Email referencing your recent project by name and your specific role.",
        defense: "Limit public information sharing on social media (OSINT)."
    },
    {
        term: "Vishing (Voice Phishing)",
        category: "Attack Vector",
        definition: "Phishing conducted by phone. Attackers often use voice modulation or deepfakes.",
        example: "A call from 'Bank Fraud Department' asking for your PIN.",
        defense: "Hang up and call the official number on the back of your card."
    },
    {
        term: "Baiting",
        category: "Attack Vector",
        definition: "Using a physical or digital lure to trap a victim.",

    },
    {
        term: "Quid Pro Quo",
        category: "Attack Vector",
        definition: "Something for something. Attackers promise a benefit in exchange for information.",
        example: "Calling random extensions claiming to be IT Support and offering to 'fix the slow internet' if they give their password.",
        defense: "Legitimate IT support will never ask for your password."
    },

    // Technical Terms
    {
        term: "Deepfake",
        category: "Technology",
        definition: "Synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness using AI.",
        example: "Fake audio of a CEO authorizing a transfer.",
        defense: "Look for unnatural blinking, audio glitches, or ask a challenge question only the real person would know."
