## 🎯 About

**SocEng Lab** is an open-source adaptive social engineering simulation platform that brings academic rigor to security awareness training. This AI-driven tool adapts attacks in real-time based on user responses like a "choose-your-own-adventure" experience powered by Cialdini's six principles of influence and threat actor playbooks. By mapping attack scenarios to Cialdini's principles and implementing persona-based adaptive branching, teams can measure and improve human resilience against social engineering at scale.

**THIS TOOL IS FOR AUTHORIZED SECURITY TESTING AND TRAINING ONLY**

- ✅ Use only with explicit written consent from all participants
- ✅ All simulations run locally - NO external messages sent
- ✅ Designed for controlled training environments
- ❌ DO NOT use against real targets without authorization
- ❌ Unauthorized use may violate laws (e.g., CFAA, GDPR, local anti-fraud laws)

By using this tool, you agree to use it ethically and legally. The developers assume no liability for misuse.

## ✨ Features

- **Adaptive Challenge Engine**: Node-based branching scenarios with dynamic escalation
- **Quiz Mode**: Multiple-choice assessments with instant feedback
- **LLM Integration**: Optional pretext generation (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, generic)
- **Bilingual**: English and Indonesian (i18n ready)
- **Offline-First**: Works without network by default
- **Single User**: Seeded authentication, no registration
- **Scoring Engine**: 0-100 susceptibility score with Cialdini category breakdown
