## 🎯 About

**Pretexta** is an advanced social engineering simulation lab designed to help security professionals, educators, and organizations understand *why* attacks succeed. 

Rather than focusing on technical exploits, Pretexta models the **human layer**—simulating how attackers manipulate trust, authority, urgency, and cognitive biases using sophisticated AI Personas.

**Key Difference:** Unlike standard phishing simulators that just send emails, Pretexta engages users in **real-time, interactive conversations** with AI-driven threat actors, providing a safe sandbox to experience the pressure of a targeted attack.

> **DISCLAIMER**: THIS TOOL IS FOR AUTHORIZED SECURITY TESTING AND TRAINING ONLY. 
> ANY UNAUTHORIZED USE AGAINST REAL TARGETS IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

## ✨ Features

- **🗣️ Real-Time AI Chat**: Interact with dynamic AI personas (e.g., "The Urgent CEO", "Angry IT Support") powered by **Groq (Llama 3)**, Gemini, or Claude.
- **🧠 Adaptive Psychology**: Scenarios are built on Cialdini's 6 Principles of Influence (Reciprocity, Scarcity, Authority, etc.).
- **⚡ Interactive AI Lab**: A WhatsApp-style chat interface where you must defend against active pretexting attempts.
- **📊 Win/Loss Detection**: The AI automatically detects if you've been compromised (shared credentials, clicked links) or successfully defended the asset.
- **📝 Mission Logs**: Detailed history of your simulations with scoring and analysis.
- **🛡️ Quiz Mode**: Assess your theoretical knowledge of social engineering tactics.
- **🌐 Bilingual Support**: Full support for English and Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia).

## 🤝 Contributions

We welcome contributions! Please see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to add new scenarios, quizzes, or features.

### Adding a New Scenario
You can add new scenarios easily by creating a YAML file in `data/sample/`:

```yaml
type: ai_challenge
title: "The Fake Recruiter"
persona:
  name: "Sarah Jenkins"
  role: "Recruiter at TechCorp"
  goal: "Get user to open malicious resume PDF"
  style: "Professional, Friendly, slightly pushy"
```

Then run `make seed` to import it.
