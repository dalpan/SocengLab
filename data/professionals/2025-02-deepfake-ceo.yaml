      explanation: "You fell for an AI Voice Clone (Vishing). Attackers can now clone voices with 3 seconds of audio. NEVER authorize financial transactions based on voice alone. Always use a secondary channel (OOB) or official ticketing system."

      explanation: "Excellent handling of pressure. Sticking to 'No Ticket, No Fix' is your shield against executive fraud. The attacker gave up when they realized you wouldn't break protocol."
